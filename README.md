Hi I'm Aadhithya aka Derpitron! I study electronics and computer engineering.

## My interests:
- broad-edge Calligraphy
- Car sketches
- Electronics hacking
- Cool software

## In the past, I've had the following interests
- Computer fonts (my favorites are Grotesk and Garamond style)
- Conlanging and Worldbuilding
- Etymology and the love of evolution of human language/cultures
- EDM/Drum and bass music production

## Right now, I'm working on:
- A dynamic camera mod for BeamNG drive, that shifts and pans and rotates along with the inertia of the car. The intention is to give you, the player, a violent sense of speed, like the great legends of old need for speed and street racing games. This one takes signal processing and turns it into something of real practical use.
- My homelab server and associated infrastructure. It needs linux sysadmin skills and network skills. Associated with this i flashed openwrt on my router and am currently working on getting a uart shell on the FTTH modem.
- Trying to turn a sewing machine pedal into something that could act like a real pedal for racing video games. This needs some analog electronics skills and making sure i don't short the 220v mains connections

I love the spirit of free culture and foss and try to help out in it however I can, by teaching or awareness.
